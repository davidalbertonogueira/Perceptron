# Perceptron

Simple perceptron c++ implementation. 

The single-layer perceptron is the simplest feedforward neural network.

The perceptron, being a linear classifier, will only converge if the training set is linearly separable, i.e. if there is a hyperplane that separates the positive samples (or examples) from the negative ones.
